            Caring for the poor and needy people and helping them is a noble endeavor. The more you give to poor and needy people, the more you strengthen their dependency. If you give them the chance or opportunity, you'll see an effective and long-lasting improvement in their lives.One of the better ways to help the poor and needy people is to give
            them a hand up rather than a hand out. Giving them moral support,
            showing heartfelt humility and respect makes them aware that
            someone really does care about them and trying to improve their
            condition. By providing them with the opportunities to improve their
            condition on their own would increase their self-esteem and help them
            in overcoming barriers they face every day. Work with the poor and
            needy people and help them discover their own capabilities and
            capacity and putting them to use at the right place at the right time.
            Support them and let them know that they have something of value
            which can be used for meeting their basic requirements. <br>
            Here we are providing some blogs and news portal links for learning more about these helpless peoples.
